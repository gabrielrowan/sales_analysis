## Intro

This is a data analysis project which examines the sales data from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data).
It goes through a list of 10 questions about the data, using graphs when needed 

All the graphs can be found in the `Graphs` folder in this `.readme`
The code, including how the graphs were generated, can be found in the [analyse_sales file](https://github.com/gabrielrowan/sales_analysis/blob/main/analyse_sales.ipynb).

## Files 

- `analyse_py.ipynb` - The jupyter notebook containing the code analysing the data, generating and saving the graphs
- `explore_sales_data.ipynb` - Checks that the data is clean and ready for analysis

## Analysis

When analysing this data, I looked at the following: 

1) Displaying a bar chart showing sales per country, ranked highest to lowest
2) Showing how the different deal sizes (small, medium, large) make up the total sales in the top 5 selling countries
3) Comparing the sales trends over time in the UK in 2003 and 2004
5) Showing the sales revenue of different product lines in the US
6) Examining who were top 10 customers whose orders make the most money
7) Showing the Percentage Share of Revenue from Top 3 Customers

8) Answering how much of the total revenue is made from the top 10 customers
9) Calculating how many orders were cancelled
10) Working out how much revenue was lost from cancelled orders
