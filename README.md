## Intro

This is a data analysis project which examines the sales data from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data).
It goes through a list of 10 questions about the data, using graphs when needed to illustrate the answer

All the graphs can be found in the Graphs folder 
The code, including how the graphs were generated, can be found in the [analyse_sales file](https://github.com/gabrielrowan/sales_analysis/blob/main/analyse_sales.ipynb).
